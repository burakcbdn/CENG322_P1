## CENG322 Programming Assignment 1 Report
 - In the first question I used `while read -r` to iterate over contents of input file. The first problem I experienced was `read` command not reading the last line of the file. I fixed this problem by using `grep` command at the input part of the while loop.
 
 - In this question, normal input used instead of prompt input because sequence of inputs required. In the loop, program takes all numbers and adds them to the total number until end is given. Then, displays the result.
 
 - The last question requires some argument checking before the main task. First it checks whether entered path is directory or not (even if it is empty, it checks and returns true automatically). If not directory, program exits with status 1 and displays “Not a directory”. If it is a directory, runs ls command with -l parameter and stores the result in FILES parameter. Then using these files, while loop iterates through file details and checks details after splitting the string (4th index is file length, 8th index is file name) according to this data, if length is zero, program removes the current file in the given path and increments the total removed file count. At the end of loop, if removed count zero, program displays “No files removed”, if removed count not zero and directory argument is not given program displays “.. zero-length files are removed from current directory” otherwise program displays default output from the homework file.
